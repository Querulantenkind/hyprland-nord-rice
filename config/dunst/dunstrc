    ### Display ###

    # Which monitor should the notifications be displayed on.
    monitor = 0

    # Display notification on focused monitor. Possible modes are:
    #   mouse: follow mouse pointer
    #   keyboard: follow window with keyboard focus
    #   none: don't follow anything
    #
    # "keyboard" needs a window manager that exports the
    # _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW property.
    # This should be the case for almost all modern window managers.
    #
    # If this option is set to mouse or keyboard, the monitor option
    # will be ignored.

# Shortcut definitions
# Xev/dexev is a tool to find the keysyms and modifiers
# for keys/buttons.
#
# Shortcuts are specified as [modifier+][modifier+]...key
# Available modifiers are "ctrl", "mod1" (the alt-key), "mod2",
# "mod3" and "mod4" (windows key).
# Xev will report as "mod4", and on most systems mod4 is Super.
# NOTIFICATION: dunstctl is a control command that can be used to
# interact with dunst.
#
# For example:
# dunstctl set-paused toggle
# dunstctl action
# dunstctl close

# Shortcut to pause dunst
# shortucts = ctrl+shift+space

# Shortcut to toggle dunst on/off
# shortcuts = ctrl+shift+period

# Shortcut to show history
# shortcuts = ctrl+shift+slash

# Shortcut to show context menu
# shortcuts = ctrl+shift+semicolon
